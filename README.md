# Final-Project-frontend
For our final project at SALT we created an app that helps track devices lent to students and employees of SALT.

We are using React, GoogleAuth, and Chart.js on the frontend, Node, Express, Mongoose and JWTs for the backend, and MongoDB as our database.

Public version can be found [here](https://slap-public.herokuapp.com/).
